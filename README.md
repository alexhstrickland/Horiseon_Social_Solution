# Horiseon_Social_Solution

## Description

For this project, we are taking an existing website and refactoring the code to meet accessibility standards. We modified the source code so that it is now semantically correct and follows a logical structure. By enhancing the accessibility of the webpage, we are ensuring that individuals with disabilities can properly access the website with the appropriate technologies. 


The first thing we accomplished was to change out the non-semantic elements to semantic elements. This includes but is not limited to:

* header
* nav
* section
* figure
* main
* footer

Next, we added accessible alt attributes to ensure that readers will be able to have a description on hand of the images included in the website. The CSS was the next task to tackle by consolidating properties and selectors to provide a more efficient structure. 

THe final task of the project was to provide adequate commenting to the html and css files to provide clear and concise information regarding the code. A descriptive title has been added to the project and the project deployed at a live URL.
